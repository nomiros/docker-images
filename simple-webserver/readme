Even though you EXPOSE port 8000 in your Dockerfile, you still need to map it to an external port at runtime with a command like docker run -p 8000:8000 -t tmp.

The EXPOSE in the Dockerfile only enables you to use the shorthand docker run -t -P tmp where the capital P tells docker to automatically map all exposed ports to external ports.





to access it:


curl http://127.0.0.1:8000
